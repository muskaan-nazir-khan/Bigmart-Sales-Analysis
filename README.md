Predicts item sales using inputs like:


Item Type, Item Weight, Item MRP


Fat Content, Outlet Size, Location Type


Outlet Identifier and Outlet Type


Clean UI with dropdowns, sliders, and user-friendly layout


# Machine Learning Workflow


Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, label encoding, and feature selection


Model Used: Trained a Multiple Linear Regression (54% accuracy) and XGBoost ( 97% accuracy)




This app helps BigMart estimate potential sales for any item based on its attributes  useful for inventory planning, pricing decisions, and outlet performance tracking

Evaluation: Used metrics like RMSE and RÂ² to assess performance
